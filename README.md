## Linear regression

Linear regression is used to predict the value of an outcome variable y on the basis of one or more input predictor variables x. 

Used to establish a linear relationship between the predictor and response variables.

Predictor and response variables are related through an equation in which the exponent of both these variables is 1. 

Mathematically, a linear relationship denotes a straight line, when plotted as a graph.

### Equation for linear regression:
``` 
y = ax + b  
```
